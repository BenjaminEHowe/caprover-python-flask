# caprover-python-flask
A simple application using Python's [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) framework, deployed as a Docker container to a [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) instance using GitHub Actions.
While the application doesn't do anything fancy, this repository aims to demonstrate best practice for deploying a Python-based application using GitHub Actions and CapRover.
